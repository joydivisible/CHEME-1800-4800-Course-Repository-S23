## Problem Set 1: Introduction to DNA Cryptography 

#### Student: Lara Capellino, lc834

This folder contains the implementation of a DNA Crypyography program, where the input is a string labeled as "plaintext". The string gets converted into codons (combinations of DNA bases in a series of three). The series of codons is then stored and called by the decrypt function, which converts them back to regular text.
