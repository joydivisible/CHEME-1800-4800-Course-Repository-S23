# Problem Set 4: Principle component analysis (PCA) of synthetic patient data
## Students: Hayden Spector, Kayla Stephenson, Lara Capellino

Solution to PS5 - This problem set involves different operations with a data file containing values for the maximum reaction velocity as related to substrate concentration. By reading the file into a matrix containing the data on velocities and a vector containing our output values, it is possible to compute different values of interest and perform calculations on error distributions.
